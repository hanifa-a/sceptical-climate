	<p class="p-summary">The role of media in a democracy is to truthfully report contemporary events and issues to the public. This includes scientific evidence about the crucial issue of climate change. If people are confused or ignorant about potential threats, they cannot be expected to support action to confront them. This report looks at coverage of climate science in ten Australian newspapers between February and April in 2011 and 2012 and asks: What is the quality and nature of climate science reporting in Australia?  What role are these  publications playing in informing the public about climate science?</p>

	<p class="p-summary">Climate change policy has dominated Australian politics in recent years. While journalists often criticise others for poor communication, they should also be accountable for how they communicate climate change. This Australian Centre for Independent Journalism report analyses how ten publications in mainstream corporate media covered carbon policy for six months in 2011.</p>
