  <h2 id="key-findings"><span class="chapter-number">2.</span> Key Findings</h2>

  <p>This summary contains key points from the report, with links to the relevant sections and data from which the findings are drawn.</p>

  <p>Although this report covers a different time period, the key findings for this study of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/research-design-methodology/#h[WstFeT,1,2]" title="See the list of papers and read about the methodolgy used">ten Australian newspapers</a> from February to April in both 2011 and 2012 can be considered in light of the <a href="http://sceptical-climate.investigate.org.au/part-1/key-findings/" title="Section 2 of Sceptical Climate Part 1: Climate Change Policy, published 2011">key findings of Sceptical Climate Part One</a>.</p>

  <p>Part One of our study found the coverage of climate change in Australia in 2011 was mostly framed within a vociferous political debate about climate change policy. Many stories about climate change policy made no significant reference to climate science at all. (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/quantity-of-coverage/" title="Quantity of climate science coverage">See Section 4.2</a>).</p>

  <p>The focus of this study is the coverage of climate science. It includes all articles between February and April 2011 and the same period in 2012 that mentioned the findings of climate science. Some of these stories are also framed within the debate about climate change policy. Others mention climate science findings in the context of other environmental issues. Other focus on climate scientists or climate science research findings.</p>

	  <ul>

	    <li><p>There were 602 articles across the two three-month periods in ten publications that made significant reference to climate science.</p></li>

	    <li><p>Just under one third of 602 articles did not accept the scientific consensus that human beings are major contributors to global warming. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#p[TnoIom],h[TnoIom,1,2,3]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.6, Scepticism and climate science coverage">See Section 4.6</a></span></p></li>

	    <li><p>35% of stories that made significant mentions of climate science did so in the context of climate change policy. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/quantity-of-coverage/#p[Awmota],h[Awmota,1,2,3,4]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.2, Quantity of climate science coverage">See Section 4.2</a></span></p></li>

	    <li><p>There was a decrease of nearly 20% in articles referencing climate science in ten publications between February and April in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/quantity-of-coverage/#figure_4_2_1" title="Figure 4.2.1: Total articles covering the climate change science, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. to Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Section 4.2</a></span></p></li>

	    <li><p>There was a marked difference in the quantity and quality of coverage about climate science being received in different Australian regions and by different audiences. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/quantity-of-coverage/#figure_4_2_1" title="Figure 4.2.1: Total articles covering the climate change science, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. to Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Section 4.2</a></span></p></li>

        <li><p>Publications targeting high-income readers, <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em>, <em>The Age</em> and <em>The Australian</em>, provide more coverage of climate science than those targeting lower income readers. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/quantity-of-coverage/#p[TAwNaq],h[TAwNaq,1,TtFTtF,1]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.2, Quantity of climate science coverage">See Section 4.2</a></span></p></li>

	    <li><p><em>The Australian</em>, which is Australia’s only national newspaper targeted at a general audience, published the most articles (24% of 602 articles making significant mention of climate science). <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a class="scroll" href="#theaustralian" title="to further down this document, section on The Australian newspaper">See <em>The Australian</em> below</a></p></li>

	    <li><p>Fairfax Media’s <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> and <em>The Age</em> each published more articles about climate science than all publications apart from <em>The Australian</em>. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/quantity-of-coverage/#p[TtFTtF],h[TtFTtF,1]" title="Go to section 4.2 Quantity of climate science coverage">See Section 4.2</a></span></p></li>

	    <li><p>Readers in Western Australia and the Northern Territory receive very little information about climate science. <em>The West Australian</em>, which is the only metropolitan newspaper in Perth, averaged only one article every three weeks over these periods with a significant reference to climate science. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/quantity-of-coverage/#p[SWMTlr],h[SWMTlr,1,2,NCNAcs,1,2]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.2, Quantity of climate science coverage">See Section 4.2</a></span></p></li>

	    <li><p>The biggest drop of 50% in articles between 2011 and 2012 was in the biggest circulation publication, the <em>Herald Sun</em> in Melbourne. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/quantity-of-coverage/#p[THSTHS],h[THSTHS,1,2]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.2, Quantity of climate science coverage">See Section 4.2</a></span></p></li>

    <h3 id="genre">Genre of climate science articles</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><p>41% of articles (244) across the ten publications that made significant mention of climate science were news stories. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre/#figure_4_3_1" title="Figure 4.3.1: Genre breakdown of articles covering climate science across 10 Australian newspapers Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.3.1</a></span></p></li>

      <li><p>Of 244 news articles that made significant mention of climate science, 61 or 25% were less that 150 words long. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre/#figure_4_3_4" title="Figure 4.3.4: Number and length of news articles covering climate science across 10 Australian newspapers Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.3.4</a></span></p></li>

	   <li><p><em>The Courier Mail</em> had the highest proportion (66%) of news. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre/#p[TCMTCM],h[TCMTCM,1]" title="See relevant paragraph in Section 4.3 Genre of climate science articles">See Section 4.3</a></span></p></li>

	   <li><p>There were very low levels of features, which provide extra sources and perspectives, about climate science <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre/#features" title="See the section covering features in 4.3, Genre of climate science articles">See Section 4.3</a></span></p></li>

	   <li><p><em>The Australian</em>, <em>The Age</em> and the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>, all of which are targeted at higher income readers, published most of the features about climate science. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre/#p[TAhTAp],h[TAhTAp,1,2,3,4,5]" title="See the section covering features in 4.3, Genre of climate science articles">See Section 4.3</a></span></p></li>

	   <li><p><em>The Daily Telegraph</em>, <em>Herald Sun</em>, <em>The Advertiser</em>, <em>The West Australian</em>, <em>The Mercury</em> and the <em>NT News</em> had very low levels of features about climate science. The last four are dominant news sources in South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory respectively. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre/#p[OtNOtt],h[OtNOtt,1,2,THSTHS,1,TATTpa,1,2]" title="See the section covering features in 4.3, Genre of climate science articles">See Section 4.3</a></span></p></li>

	   <li><p>31% of 602 articles were commentary about climate science. This finding highlights the significant role assigned by editors to opinion writers who promote their own attitudes towards climate change. Most commentary is written by non-scientists. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre/#figure_4_3_1" title="Figure 4.3.1: Genre breakdown of articles covering climate science across 10 Australian newspapers Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.3.1</a></span></p></li>

	   <li><p>44% of words in 602 articles were allocated to comment pieces that covered climate science compared to only 22% of words to news articles about climate science. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre/#number-of-words-and-genre" title="See the section of word count in 4.3, Genre of climate science articles">See Section 4.3</a></span></p></li>

	   <li><p>The <em>Herald Sun</em> had the highest proportion of commentary (65% of articles and 81% of word count.) and the lowest levels of news (27% of articles and 11% of words.).This is partly explained by the dominant role of Andrew Bolt, a prominent News Corp climate sceptic opinion writer. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#andrew-bolt" title="See analysis of Andrew Bolts contribution in Section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See Section 4.6</a> for more on Bolt’s role. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/genre" title="Go to section 4.3 Genre">See Section 4.3</a></span></p></li>

    <h3 id="prominence">Prominence of climate science coverage</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Australian print publications did not feature climate science stories prominently during February to April in 2011 and 2012. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/prominence-of-coverage/#figure_4_4_1" title="Figure 4.4.1: Placement of climate science articles, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.4.1</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>There were 26 front-page articles in 10 publications making significant mention climate science during this period. 17, or nearly two-thirds of these, appeared in 2012. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/prominence-of-coverage/#figure_4_4_1" title="Figure 4.4.1: Placement of climate science articles, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.4.1</a></span></p></li> 

	<li><p>The <em>SMH</em> was more likely than any other publication to publish articles prominently. It published 8% of articles (7) on the front page. All of these articles assumed a consensus position on climate change. 51% of <em>SMH</em> articles were on pages 2 - 8.  <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/prominence-of-coverage/#figure_4_4_1" title="Figure 4.4.1: Placement of climate science articles, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.4.1</a></span></p></li>

    <h3 id="peer-reviewed-research">Reporting of peer reviewed research</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Most Australians receive very little information from their media about peer-reviewed climate science findings. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/peer-reviewed-research/#figure_4_5_1" title="Figure 4.5.1: Number of articles that relied on peer reviewed climate science publications, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.5.1</a></span></p></li>

    <h3 id="scepticismandclimatesciencecoverage">Scepticism and climate science coverage</h3>

    <p>Scientists (over 97%) overwhelmingly agree that the activities of human beings cause climate change. This is referred to as the consensus position. The term ‘climate sceptic’ refers to those who do not accept this consensus position. Articles were coded according to whether they ‘accepted’ the consensus position; ‘suggested doubt’ about it; or outright ‘rejected’ it. The latter two positions are both sceptical of the consensus position. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#coding-of-articles" title="Section on the Coding of Articles in 4.6">Get more detail on the categorisation in Section 4.6</a>.</p>

    <li><p>32% or nearly one-third of 602 articles that covered climate science either rejected or suggested doubt about the consensus position. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#p[ooaIaw],h[ooaIaw,1,2]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See Section 4.6</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>In 2012, 36% of stories did not accept the consensus position. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#figure_4_6_1" title="Figure 4.6.1: Breakdown of articles according to whether they communicated acceptance, suggested doubt or rejected the consensus position on climate science, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.6.1</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>The number of articles about climate science fell between 2011 and 2012 but the number not accepting the scientific consensus that human beings are causing dangerous climate change grew. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#p[TnoIom],h[ooaIaw,1,2,TnoIom,1,2,3]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See Section 4.6</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>Despite very high levels of certainty that human activity causes dangerous climate change and evidence about the dangerous impacts of that change, the proportion of stories accepting the consensus position on anthropogenic climate change dropped between 2011 and 2012. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#figure_4_6_1" title="Figure 4.6.1: Breakdown of articles according to whether they communicated acceptance, suggested doubt or rejected the consensus position on climate science, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.6.1</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>When measured according to words allocated to article, 31% of words were allocated to articles that did not accept the consensus position about anthropogenic climate science in 2011. This grew to 44% or nearly half of all words in 2012. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#figure_4_6_2" title="Figure 4.6.2: Breakdown of articles, by word count, according to whether they communicated acceptance, suggested doubt or rejected the consensus position on climate science, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.6.2</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>Some articles that overtly accepted the consensus position about anthropogenic climate change were produced in ways that undermined the credibility of climate scientists or the case for urgent action. This was particularly so in <em>The Australian</em>. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism" title="Go to section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See Section 4.6</a> for details and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/the-australian/" title="4.8 How The Australian builds doubt about climate scientists and their findings">Section 4.8</a> for examples</span></p></li>

    <li><p>Across the ten publications, more words (45,775 or 13%) were allocated to articles that completely rejected the notion of anthropogenic global warming than the number words in articles that referred to peer reviewed climate science research. (27748 or 8%). <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#figure_4_6_2" title="Figure 4.6.2: Breakdown of articles, by word count, according to whether they communicated acceptance, suggested doubt or rejected the consensus position on climate science, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.6.2</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>Fairfax Media’s <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> and <em>The Age</em> accept the consensus position on anthropogenic climate change. They published only 9 and 6 articles respectively which might suggest to readers that the consensus position was in doubt. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#p[UNCBwc],h[UNCBwc,1,2,3]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See Section 4.6</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>The most sceptical publications were <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> (73% of words) and <em>Herald Sun</em> (81% of words) and <em>The NT News</em> (62% of words). <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>Herald Sun</em> were also <a href="http://sceptical-climate.investigate.org.au/part-1/findings/content-of-articles/#figure_4_5_1" title="Figure 4.5.1: Number of articles that relied on peer reviewed climate science publications, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">the most biased against the carbon policy</a>. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#figure_4_6_2" title="Figure 4.6.2: Breakdown of articles, by word count, according to whether they communicated acceptance, suggested doubt or rejected the consensus position on climate science, across 10 Australian newspapers from Feb. - Apr. 2011 & 2012">See Figure 4.6.2</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>Unlike other News Corp publications, <em>The Mercury</em> and <em>The Courier Mail</em> were accepting of the consensus position. In 2013, the Courier Mail has become more sceptical.

      <li><p>Andrew Bolt plays a significant and strategic role in the production of climate scepticism in Australia. He is employed and heavily promoted by News Corp. He also has his own show <em>The Bolt Report</em> on <em>Channel Ten</em> and is featured almost daily on right wing radio station <em>2GB</em>. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#andrew-bolt" title="See analysis of Andrew Bolts contribution in Section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See <em>Andrew Bolt</em> in Section 4.6</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>When considered from the viewpoint of word count, Andrew Bolt wrote a total of 13,281 words, which is 49% or nearly half of all words in articles that included material about climate science in the <em>Herald Sun</em>. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#p[BwcTwt],h[BwcTwt,1,2,WcfWcf,1]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See <em>Andrew Bolt</em> in Section 4.6</a></span></p></li>

    <li><p>Apart from the 20 articles in the <em>Herald Sun</em>, Bolt wrote five sceptical articles in <em>The Advertiser</em>, four sceptical articles in <em>NT News</em> and 5 of 21 in <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> that rejected the consensus position. He was also published during this period in <em>The Cairns Post</em> and <em>The Townsville Bulletin</em>. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#p[BieAcw],h[BieAcw,1,2,3]" title="See relevant paragraph in section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See <em>Andrew Bolt</em> in Section 4.6</a> )</p></li>

    <li><p>There are hundreds of climate sceptic posts on Andrew Bolt’s blog that News Corp promotes as <a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/">“Australia’s most read political blog”</a>. Readers comments are overwhelmingly sceptic. <em>The Australian</em> occasionally picks up on Bolt’s sceptic columns and promotes them through further stories. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#andrew-bolt" title="See analysis of Andrew Bolts contribution in Section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See <em>Andrew Bolt</em> in Section 4.6</a></span></p></li>

        <li><p>Bolt rejects established scientific bodies and scientists as authoritative sources on climate change. His opinion pieces target climate scientists, journalists, policy advisors and politicians who accept the consensus position, by accusing them of telling lies, misleading the public and being hypocritical. <span class="supporting finding-reference"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/part-2/findings/scepticism/#bolt-example-one" title="Example One: ‘Secrets Out: No gain from carbon tax pain’ in Section 4.6 Scepticism and climate science coverage">See <em>Example One: ‘Secrets Out: No gain from carbon tax pain’</em> in Section 4.6</a></span></p></li>
