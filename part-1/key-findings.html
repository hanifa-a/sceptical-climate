    <h2><span class="chapter-number">2.</span> Key Findings</h2>

    <h3 id="coverage_of_climate_change_policy">2.1 Coverage of Climate Change Policy</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Overall, negative coverage of the Gillard government’s carbon policy across ten newspapers outweighed positive coverage across ten Australian newspapers by 73% to 27%. (Note: After neutral items were discounted). (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/content-of-articles" title="Go to 4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy">4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>All papers contained some positive and a substantial amount of neutral material. The highest level of neutral articles was found in <em>The Age</em> and <em>The Mercury</em>, the lowest level was found in the <em>NT News</em> and <em>The Daily Telegraph</em>. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/content-of-articles" title="Go to 4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy">4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>After neutral items were discounted, negative coverage (82%) across News Ltd newspapers far outweighed positive (18%) articles. This indicates a very strong stance against the carbon policy adopted by the company that controls most Australian metropolitan newspapers, and the only general national daily. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/content-of-articles" title="Go to 4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy">4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>By comparison, Fairfax was far more balanced in its coverage of the policy than News Ltd publications with 57% positive articles outweighing 43% negative articles. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/content-of-articles" title="Go to 4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy">4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>The Age</em> was more positive (67%) rather than negative towards the policy than any other newspaper. <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> was the most negative (89%) rather than positive of newspapers. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/content-of-articles" title="Go to 4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy">4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Headlines were less balanced than the actual content of articles. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/headline-stance" title="Go to 4.4 Headline stance">4.4 Headline stance</a>).</p></li>
        <li><p>Neutral articles were more likely to be headlined negative (41%) than positive (19%). (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/defining-the-debate" title="Go to 4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate">4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Readers relying on metropolitan newspapers living in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane received more coverage of carbon policy issues than readers in Perth, Adelaide and Darwin. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/number-of-articles" title="Go to 4.2 Number of articles">4.2 Number of articles</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>The Australian</em> gave far more space to the coverage of climate change than any other newspaper. Its articles were coded 47% negative, 44% neutral and 9% positive. When neutrals were discounted, there were 84% negative articles compared to 17% positive. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/content-of-articles" title="Go to 4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy">4.5 Content of articles: Stance towards the 2011 Carbon Reduction Policy</a>)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="language_used_to_define_the_debate">2.2 Language Used to Define the Debate</h3>

    <p>The words used to describe issues influence the way it is discussed. The carbon emissions reduction policy was originally referred to as the carbon pricing policy, although from the beginning, the Opposition leader Tony Abbott from referred to it as a ‘tax’. Under questioning, Prime Minister Julia Gillard agreed on February 24 that the policy would be <em>“effectively like a tax”</em> (<em>7.30 Report</em>, 24 Feb 2011).</p>

    <p>The articles were coded on whether they referred to the carbon reduction scheme as a ‘price’, ‘tax’ or both.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Over half the articles only used the word ‘tax’ (51%), 11% used ‘price’ and another 39% referred to both. Once again there are differences between Fairfax and News Ltd.’s metropolitan newspapers. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/defining-the-debate" title="Go to 4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate">4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>77% of <em>The Daily Telegraph</em>, 70% of <em>The Courier Mail</em> and 62% of the <em>Herald Sun</em> articles referred only to ‘tax’, whereas only 29% of articles in <em>The Age</em> and 37% of articles in <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em> did so. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/defining-the-debate" title="Go to 4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate">4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>The Australian</em> used only ‘tax’ in 44% of articles and only ‘price’ in 11% of cases. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/defining-the-debate" title="Go to 4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate">4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>The repeated description of the scheme as a ‘tax’ tended to reinforce a perception that the policy was aimed at individual consumers rather than large companies. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/defining-the-debate" title="Go to 4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate">4.6 Carbon Tax or Carbon Policy? Defining the debate</a>)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="framing_of_arguments_against_the_policy">2.3 Framing of Arguments Against the Policy</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Negative arguments against the policy were strongly focused on the impact of the policy on <em>The Australian</em> economy. Some papers placed more emphasis on broader issues such as fears of reduced investment and job losses, while other focused on rising prices. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/dominant-themes-in-coverage" title="Go to 4.7 Dominant themes in coverage">4.7 Dominant themes in coverage</a>)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="sources_in_the_australian_media">2.4 Sources in the Australian Media</h3>

    <p>These findings are based on an analysis of the first three sources quoted in all news and features.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>11% of news and features quoted no source and 30% of the rest quoted only one source. The claims by many single sources about the likely impact of the carbon policy were not tested against the views of other sources. Only 42% of the rest of the articles included more than two sources. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Political sources were used more frequently than any other sources (54% of all sources), reflecting the intensity of the political debate. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Federal Labor sources were 28% of all first sources. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Business sources (23%) received greater representation overall than Coalition political sources (18%). (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Fossil fuel lobby and other big business sources opposed to the policy were very strongly represented, often without any critique or second source. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Clean energy and other businesses sources in favour of the tax received low coverage, particularly in News Ltd papers. They complained during the campaign that they were excluded and adopted specific strategies to address this with some success. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Although they played a key role in negotiations, <em>The Australian</em> Greens received low coverage (5% of all sources). (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Business sources (23%) receive more coverage than all Australian civil society sources together including unions, NGOS, think tanks, activists, members of the public, religious spokespeople, scientists and academics (17%). (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Business sources quoted 4 or more times over the 6-month period were quoted being negative towards the policy in almost 80% of occasions. Many Australian readers would have been left with the impression that the nearly the entire business community was opposed to the carbon price policy. In fact this was far from the truth. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Bluescope Steel was quoted 71 times, substantially more than any other business source. This was more than the number of times all NGOs and scientists combined were quoted. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Figure 17 also shows that peak councils such as the Business Council of Australia, Minerals Councils of Australia and Australian Coal Association achieved very strong representation. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Academics and scientists were also poorly represented. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/sources-quoted" title="Go to 4.8 Sources quoted">4.8 Sources quoted</a>)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="editorials">2.5 Editorials</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><p>23% of editorials were positive, compared to 15% of positive articles in the entire sample. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/editorials" title="Go to 4.9 Editorials">4.9 Editorials</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>The Daily Telegraph</em>, <em>Herald Sun</em>, <em>The Courier Mail</em> and <em>The West Australian</em> were all clearly editorially opposed to the policy. From the point of view of editorials, <em>The Age</em> was the most positive publication. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/editorials" title="Go to 4.9 Editorials">4.9 Editorials</a>)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="opinion">2.6 Opinion</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Journalists or regular columnists wrote 75% of opinion pieces. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>59% of that commentary was negative, 23% neutral and 18% positive. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>All newspapers carried some positive commentary. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>The <em>Herald Sun</em> opinion writers were overwhelmingly negative (96%). <em>The Courier Mail</em> (89%), <em>The Australian</em> (85%), <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> (85%), <em>The NT News</em> (85%) and <em>The West Australian</em> (85%) were also very negative in their commentary. (When neutral figures were removed). (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>The Mercury</em> was more balanced in its commentary than other News Ltd papers. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Andrew Bolt and Terry McCrann, who are sceptical towards the scientific consensus on anthropomorphic climate change, published more opinion pieces on the carbon pricing policy than any other commentators. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Together, opinion writers who are sceptical of the scientific consensus on climate change including McCrann, Bolt, Tim Blair, Miranda Devine, Piers Akerman and Christopher Pearson accounted for at least 21% of all words of commentary published by journalists and regular commentators in the ten newspapers over this period. Their columns are prominently featured online, often accompanied by highly negative cartoons and illustrations. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Opinion pieces in <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em> and <em>The Age</em> were more evenly distributed between negative and positive than News Ltd opinion pieces. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>The Age</em> was the only paper to publish more positive commentary (59%) compared to negative (41%). (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Fairfax newspapers did not publish any opinion articles by climate sceptics about climate policy, during this period. (See <a href="{{ site.url }}/part-1/findings/opinion" title="Go to 4.10 Opinion">4.10 Opinion</a>)</p></li>
