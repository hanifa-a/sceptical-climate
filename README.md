# Sceptical Climate Report

By Professor Wendy Bacon

Design and web development by [Collagraph](http://collagraph.com.au/)

## Development

This project is built as a [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/), built to be served over [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To get set up to build the site locally, to test changes for example, follow the [Jekyll project's instructions on installing the prerequisites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to work on a Jekyll site.

Run `bundle install` to install Jekyll and other dependencies.

Start up the Jekyll server and watch process with:

    bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

The site will then be available at http://localhost:4000/

### CSS

Previously this project used SASS to generate the style.scss file.

The old `.scss` files have been archived to .`/css/old-scss/`.
Now `style.css` and `print.css` are updated directly.
